BANDCAMPDL
==========

bandcampdl is a quick and dirty program used to download music album from bandcamp website.
It don't have many capabilities, isn't configurable and may hangs if an album cannot be
completely streamed.

I surely will continue to work on it one day.

## Usage

You need to provide an url to an album with a stream capability.

  bandcampdl -u 'http://herbrecordings.bandcamp.com/album/sampling-the-moon'

The files will be downloaded in the current directory with a name corresponding to
  '%2.2f - %s' % (<track number>, <track title>
