BANDCAMPDL
==========

bandcampdl is a quick and dirty program used to download music album from bandcamp website.
It don't have many capabilities, isn't configurable and may hangs if an album cannot be
completely streamed.

I surely will continue to work on it one day.


## Usage

You need to provide an url to an album with a stream capability.

    bandcampdl -u 'http://herbrecordings.bandcamp.com/album/sampling-the-moon'

The optional -o parameter can be used to indicate where to download the album.
bandcampdl will create a directory in this directory, using the artist name as the directory
name. Another directory named '<album year> - <album name>' will be created.
Audio tracks will be downloaded under the name '<track number>, <track title>'

Directory names can be change with the -a and -b option.
Similary, track names can be changed using the -t option.
Arguments of these option are format string with named arguments.
For artist and album directories, the possible arguments are:

    artist: the artist name <string>
    type: music type <string>
    release_year: <int>
    album: the album name <string>

For track names, some additional arguments can be used:

    track_num: <int>
    track_title: <string>

If one or more of the created directory is not wanted, the format string argument can be set
to an empty string. Using the default variable, the command would look like:

    $ bandcampdl -u 'http://stillmuzik.bandcamp.com/album/rage-against-my-computer' -a '%(artist)s' -b '%(release_year)4d -t '%(track_num)02d - %(track_title)s'
