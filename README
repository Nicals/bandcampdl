BANDCAMPDL
==========

bandcampdl is a quick and dirty program used to download music album from bandcamp website.
It don't have many capabilities, isn't configurable and may hangs if an album cannot be
completely streamed.

I surely will continue to work on it one day.

## Usage

You need to provide an url to an album with a stream capability.

  bandcampdl -u 'http://herbrecordings.bandcamp.com/album/sampling-the-moon'

The optional -o parameter can be used to indicate where to download the album.
bandcampdl will create a directory in this directory, using the artist name as the directory
name. Another directory named '<album year> - <album name>' will be created.
Audio tracks will be downloaded under the name '<track number>, <track title>'
